GEFIT: KSTAR EFIT enhancing toolkit
===================================

GEFIT enhances KSTAR EFIT reconstruction with harnessing the high resolution diagnostics, 
evaluating the external H&CD and re-furbishing the MSE data.

Connection to EFIT and MDS
    If you need to get a detailed equilibrium to analyze plasma physics, 
    GEFIT will get the basic information from diagnostic system such as MDS and
    EFIT(magnetic or MSE-only).

Profile fitting and fast ion calculation
    To build the plasma temperature and density distribution, simulated MSE and fast ion spatial information,
    GEFIT can provide the profile fitting and fast ion pressure and current drive
    using the GFIT tool and NUBEAM wrapper.

GUI-based kinetic EFIT
    From the physics-based information, GEFIT supports GUIs for the entire equilibrium reconstruction
    Users can control the inputs, check the results and optimize it for proper purposes,
    following experimental data as accurately as possible.
